Replication materials for "A Causal Framework for Observational Studies of
Discrimination"
---

This repository contains two `R` notebooks: `simulation.Rmd`, which contains
the simulation of prosecutorial charging decisions described in Section 3 of
the main text; and `appendix.Rmd` which provides simulations of the examples
constructed in the proofs of Theorem A.5 and Proposition B.1 in the appendices.
Running `simulation.Rmd` requires approximately 6 hours of wall-clock time when
run in parallel, while `appendix.Rmd` runs in a few minutes.
